					<p>A white robin, and a white quail have occasionally been seen. It is mentioned in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Audubon</i> as remarkable that the nest of a robin should be found on the ground; but this bird seems to be less particular than most in the choice of a building spot. I have seen its nest placed under the thatched roof of a deserted barn, and in one instance, where the adjacent country was nearly destitute of trees, together with two of the phoebe, upon the end of a board in the loft of a sawmill, but a few feet from the saw, which vibrated several inches with the motion of the machinery. <a href="natural-history-of-massachusetts.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Another and kindred spirit contemporary with Raleigh, who survives yet more exclusively in his reputation, rather than in his works, and has been the subject perhaps of even more and more indiscriminate praise, is Sir Philip Sidney; a man who was no less a presence to his contemporaries, though we now look in vain in his works for satisfactory traces of his greatness. Who, dying at the age of thirty-two, having left no great work behind him, or the fame of a single illustrious exploit, has yet left the rumor of a character for heroic impulses and gentle behavior which bids fair to survive the longer lives and more illustrious deeds of many a worthy else, the splendor of whose reputation seems to have blinded his critics to the faults of his writings. So that we find his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Arcadia</i> spoken of with vague and dubious praise as “a book most famous for rich conceits and splendor of courtly expressions.” With regard to whom also this reason is assigned why no monument should be erected to him, that “he is his own monument whose memory is eternized in his writings, and who was born into the world to show unto our age a sample of ancient virtue,” and of whom another says, “It was he whom Queen Elizabeth called her Philip; the Prince of Orange, his master; and whose friendship my Lord Brook was so proud of, that he would have no other epitaph on his grave than this:</p>

					<p>Arabella Stuart (born about 1575) was James <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>’s first cousin, the daughter of Charles Stuart, fifth Earl of Lennox, Lord Darnley’s elder brother. About 1588 she had come up to London to be presented to Elizabeth, and on that occasion had amused Raleigh with her gay accomplishments. The legal quibble on which her claim was founded was the fact that she was born in England, whereas James as a Scotchman was supposed to be excluded. Arabella was no pretender; her descent from Margaret, the sister of Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, was complete, and if James had died childless, and she had survived him, it is difficult to see how her claim could have been avoided in favor of the Suffolk line. <a href="sir-walter-raleigh.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This passage about Alexander and Epaminondas is preceded in Ralegh, as copied by Thoreau in the scrapbook, by some general remarks on that remarkable quality in a few men which Ralegh seems to have felt in himself, which, as he wrote, “Guided handfuls of men against multitudes of equal bodily strength, contrived victories beyond all hope and discourse of reason, converted the fearful passions of his own followers into magnanimity, and the valor of his enemies into cowardice. Such spirits have been stirred up in sundry ages of the world, and in divers parts thereof, to erect and cast down again, to establish and to destroy, and to bring all things, persons and states to the same certain ends which the infinite Spirit of the Universal, piercing, moving and governing all things, hath ordained.” It was passages like this, in his speech and writings, that laid Ralegh open to the charge of atheism, which seems to have been first brought against him at the same time that his friend the poet Marlowe was similarly accused, in 1592⁠–⁠3, and may have been one of the reasons why Queen Elizabeth withdrew her favor from Ralegh about that time. The definite accusations against Marlowe, which were sent to Queen Elizabeth in June, 1592, apparently, were from the mouth of one Richard Baine, who was hanged for felony two years after, and contained these words, perhaps pointing towards Ralegh: “That one Richard Cholmelei hath confessed that he was persuaded by Marlowe’s reason to become an atheist. These things shall by good and honest men be proved to be his opinions and common speeches, and that this Marlowe doth not only hold them himself, but almost in every company he cometh, persuadeth men to atheism⁠—willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins, and utterly scorning both God and his ministers⁠ ⁠… He saith, moreover, that he hath quoted a number of contrarieties out of the Scriptures, which he hath given to some great men, who in convenient time shall be named.” That Ralegh was one of these “great men” is highly probable; at any rate, the accusation of atheism was then secretly brought against him, and was likely to have weighed with Elizabeth. Ralegh, with Sidney, is believed to have been one of the English circle who associated with Giordano Bruno, during his short residence in England, a few years before Sidney’s death; and Bruno also made himself liable to a like charge of atheism. <cite>—⁠<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.

					<p>These lines appear in “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Fourth Day of the First Week</span>” of Sylvester’s version of Guillaume Salluste du Bartas’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Divine Weeks and Works</i>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 102⁠–⁠3 of the edition of 1613.

					<p>This conceit of the influence of the stars was general in Ralegh’s day. His friend Sidney, in his Sonnet <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVI</span>, has the same thought as Ralegh, but turns it to a compliment to Stella⁠—</p>

					<p>In what follows, concerning the powers and bodily nature of man, Ralegh uses what was a commonplace of his period, but expresses this quaint conceit with more grace than was customary, and closes it with that touch of regret so familiar in him, though in expression he may borrow from the Sicilian lament of Moschus for Bion. And so poetical is his prose at times, that Thoreau very properly calls the passage on the decay of oracles a “poem.” <cite>—⁠<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.

					<p>Aubrey says, “I well remember his study [at Durham-house] which was on a little turret that looked into and over the Thames, and had the prospect, which is as pleasant, perhaps, as any in the world, and which not only refreshes the eie-sight, but cheers the spirits, and (to speake my mind) I believe enlarges an ingeniose man’s thoughts.” Perhaps it was here that he composed some of his poems. <a href="sir-walter-raleigh.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The allusion here is doubtless to Thoreau’s intimate companion of forty years from early in 1843, Ellery Channing, who in the winter of 1843⁠–⁠44 was chopping cordwood on the road from Concord to Lincoln, near where Thoreau and his friend, Stearns Wheeler of Lincoln, had a cabin in the woods for study and amusement. Channing’s experiences that winter gave occasion to the making of a poem, “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Woodman</span>,” which gave title to his third book of verses, published in 1849 (the year when <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Week</i> came out) and was reprinted in 1902 with omissions and additions, from the Channing <abbr>MSS.</abbr> in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poems of Sixty-Five Years</i>. Thoreau himself had some times been a woodcutter; indeed, his range of manual employments, as he wrote his Harvard Class Secretary in 1847, made him “a Surveyor, a Gardener, a Farmer, a Painter (I mean a House-painter), a Carpenter, a Mason, a Day-laborer, a Pencil-maker, a <abbr>etc.</abbr>” In a letter to Horace Greeley, of May, 1848, Thoreau said that he had supported himself by manual labor at a dollar a day for the past five years, and yet had seen more leisure than most scholars found. He added, “There is no reason why the scholar, who professes to be a little wiser than the mass of men, should not do his work in the dirt occasionally, and by means of his superior wisdom make much less suffice for him. A wise man will not be unfortunate⁠—how then would you know but he was a fool?” His friend Emerson, however, did not find that the laborer’s strokes that he used himself in his “pleached garden” helped him to better strokes of the pen; and so employed Alcott, Channing, and Thoreau now and then to make the laborer’s strokes for him, while he meditated in his study or walked the woods and fields. <cite>—⁠<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.

					<p>In this description of Virtue, Thoreau made some use of the <abbr>MS.</abbr> afterward printed in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sanborn’s edition, in which he quoted the same passage from Sir Thomas Browne, but without giving the author’s name. A portion of the illustration of the clarion and corselet is also found in “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Service</span>.” That this whole Ralegh sketch was given as a winter lecture in the Concord Lyceum is rendered probable by his speaking hereof “waiting for warm weather,” and of a winter campaign. If the records of that Lyceum were complete we might find the very evening on which he read it there⁠—not later, I am sure, than 1845. <cite>—⁠<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.
